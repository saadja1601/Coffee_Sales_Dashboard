# Coffee Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)
##Interactive Excel dashboard visualizing global coffee sales by type and country.

## Steps I Took

1. I gathered and combined data from multiple sources using XLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH to enrich my main dataset.
2. I cleaned, formatted, and transformed the dataâ€”calculating metrics like total sales, converting codes into readable labels, and applying custom formatting for clarity.
3. I created an interactive dashboard using PivotTables and PivotCharts, with slicers and filters to drill down into coffee type, roast, size, country, and customer segments.

## Project Outcome

1. I developed a visually appealing and fully interactive Excel dashboard.
2. Stakeholders can easily analyze sales trends by coffee type, country, customer loyalty, and time period.
3. The project demonstrates my skills in Excel functions, data transformation, dashboard design, and user-friendly analytics.
